RULES:
-   if the RHS of an assignment/vardecl assignment is a reference, increment its refcounter

-   if the value of a variable before assignment isn't null, decrement its refcounter

-   if a node is a 'new' or a function call which returns an object, 
    increment it's refcounter, and decrement it at the end of its parent expression

-   before returning an object from a function, 
    remove all references to it from within the function (decrement its refcounter)
